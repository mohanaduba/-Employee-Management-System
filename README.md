 I developed a full-stack Employee Management System using React.js, Node.js, and MySQL. The project involved designing
and implementing a responsive user interface for managing employees, including features like adding, updating, and deleting
 employee records, as well as filtering data. The backend was built using Node.js and Express, with MySQL as the database to
 store employee details. Axios was used for seamless API communication between the frontend and backend.
 To ensure security, I implemented JWT-based authentication with a custom token generator and used hash functions to
 encrypt employee data. A dedicated router was set up to serve the system efficiently. Throughout the project, I focused on
 creating a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture while enhancing the user experience with an intuitive design.
